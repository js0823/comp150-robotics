COMP150 robotics project

note : When doing ROS full install, gazebo 7.0 is automatically installed. There is gazebo 8.0, but I decided not to upgrade to it.
# Guide to installing ROS and Gazebo(on Ubuntu VMware)
1. Follow http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu. Do desktop full install.
2. For gazebo, I followed http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros, and http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros_installing&cat=connect_ros.

- I can't get gazebo to run properly on my Mac's vmware running ubuntu. I am working with my desktop now.
